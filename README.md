## Installation

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ne0nclidev/infinite-yie1d.git
```
Then ```infinite-yie1d.py``` in the folder ```infinite-yie1d``` (will usually be in home directory)
```
python3 infinite-yield.py
```
(I would usually run it in terminal, but you can run this script in any software or progam that has/is a Python code executor)

## Notes

if i downloaded this script for the first time, i would find the script in the home directory. I use a MacOS so its called "Home"

For me, i don't need to ```cd``` into the home directory, because when you open terminal, it automatically defaults to home, or ```~```
```
python3 infinite-yie1d/infinite-yie1d.py
```

Make sure to find the directory on where the NE0N script is, so if you put it in your desktop, then ```Desktop/infinite-yie1d.py```. It will usually be in your home directory.
